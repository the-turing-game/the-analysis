# The analysis of the game.
Here I will analyze the underlying ideas of the broad class of games that
the 'parlor game' described by Mr. Turing as well as the same game with a
modification that he proposed belong to.
## Cooperation and Deception
First of all, it is hard not to notice that the real goal of the game
compunctiously called 'imitation' is _**deception**_ and the possible strategies of its discovery.

The presence of a cooperating player that possesses the free will and complete information
about the current state of the game is an apparent reference point for the analysis of the game as a whole.
