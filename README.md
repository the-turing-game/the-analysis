# The analysis of the game.
Here I will analyze the underlying ideas of the broad class of games that
the 'parlor game' described by Mr. Turing as well as the same game with a
modification that he proposed belong to.
## Cooperation vs. Deception
First of all, it is hard not to notice that the real goal of the game
compunctiously called by Mr. Turing 'the imitation game' is _**deception**_ and the possible strategies of its discovery.

The presence of a cooperating player that possesses free will and complete information
about the current state of the game is an apparent reference point for an interrogator and should be used as such in any 
detailed analysis of the game as a whole. 

This point largely invalidates the use of the 'Inverse Turing Game' ('recognition' of a human by a machine
without a human as a reference point) routinely called by engineers 'The Turing Test'.

Moreover, that should be the key to the best interpretation of the game; the game is played
between a Deceptor and a Cooperator, the Interrogator is just a (probabilistic) arbiter.
## What is it that is being lied about?
The original 'parlor game' is played by participants of two sufficiently well defined classes,
that have characterisics and behaviours common to the their class ('man' or 'woman'). These general 
attributes of a class (of 'men' and 'women') are known to interrogator.

The deceptor is lying about the fact that _he_does_not_belong_ to a certain _known_ class by means of
pretending to belong to another _known_ class. It is easy to notice that lying about the fact of
belonging to an _unknown_ class would be quite a bit simpler, because the interrogator of a 'man' has 
not only the signs of deception in his 'womanly' answers but also the signs of his true 'manliness' in these
answers; he would not have the positive signs of a class if does not know anything about it.

In the modification of the game invented by Mr. Turing the attributes of a class 'machine' are _not_ known neighter to the
interrogator nor to his cooperator possessing the complete information about the state of the game.
It strains my credulity that Mr. Turing used this obvious 'sleight of hand' in favor of a 'machine' and concealed it
(in plain sight) unintentionally; after all, he is making a point here, but we don't need to uphold
this asymmetry of initial knowledge in precise definition of our broad category of games.
