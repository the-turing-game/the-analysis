# The analysis of the game.
Here I will analyze the underlying ideas of the broad class of games that
the 'parlor game' described by Mr. Turing as well as the same game with a
modification that he proposed belong to.
## Cooperation and Deception
First of all, it is hard not to notice that the real goal of the game
compunctiously called 'imitation' is _**deception**_ and the possible strategies of its discovery.

The presence of a cooperating player that possesses free will and complete information
about the current state of the game is an apparent reference point for the analysis of the game as a whole.
## What is it that is being lied about
In the original 'parlor game' is played by participants of two sufficiently well defined classes,
that have characterisics and behaviours common to the their class ('man' or 'woman'). These general 
attributes of a class (of 'men' and 'women') are known to interrogator in the original game but in the modification
of the game invented by Mr. Turing the attributes of a class 'machine' are _not_ known neighter to the
interrogator nor to his cooperator possessing the complete information about the state of the game.
It strains my credulity that Mr. Turing used this obvious 'sleight of hand' in favor of a 'machine' and concealed it
(in plain sight) unintentionally; after all, he is making a point here, but we don't need to uphold
this asymmetry of initial knowledge in precise definition of our broad category of games.

The deceptor is lying about the fact that _he_ belongs to a certain _known_ class. It is easy to notice
that...
