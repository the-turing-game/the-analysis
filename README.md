# The analysis of the game.
Here I will analyze the underlying ideas of the broad class of games that
the 'parlor game' described by Mr. Turing as well as the same game with a
modification that he proposed belong to.
## Cooperation and Deception

about the state of the game will be a reference point for our analysis.
